# Spend-Smart

SpendSmart is a digital application developed to help students manage their expenses by providing insights into their spending patterns, personalized budget recommendations, and predictive analytics. The app combines budget management with smart shopping recommendations, creating a comprehensive tool to help students navigate their academic and financial challenges more effectively. As the UI/UX designer, I focused on designing user-centered interfaces that enhance usability and user experience. My work involved conducting user research, creating personas, and designing wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity UI in Figma to ensure the app was intuitive, engaging, and aligned with the needs of the student user base.
